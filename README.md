## Data-Structure-Projects

This repository contains the clean version of code for the final project of Data Structures (CSC3100) of CUHK(SZ). Full scores received for all the four projects.

- Project 1 includes recursive design of arithemetic expression evaluation, supporting functions of cosine, sine, tangent, sqrt, parantheses and possible irregular inputs; <br>
- Project 2 designs celebrated Huffman code decompression and compression implementations; <br>
- Project 3 involves using A* algorithm in solving 3 by 3 puzzles in optimal steps utilizing different heuristic functions (compared with BFS and DFS!); <br>
- Project 4 is the application of linked-lists in sparse matrix management, dealing with the simplest addition and subtraction operations (hashmaps are efficient!).
